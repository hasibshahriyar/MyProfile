# Hi! I'm Shahriyar üëã

Welcome to my portfolio! This is where I showcase my work in Data Science and DeepFake Detection research.

## What You'll Find Here

My site comes with some fun features:
- Interactive background that follows your mouse
- Smooth scrolling experience
- Visual skill representation with animated progress bars
- Mobile-friendly design that works on all your devices
- Playful animations and hover effects that make browsing enjoyable

## Simple Tech Stack

I kept things straightforward with:
- HTML5 for content
- CSS3 for styling
- Plain JavaScript for interactivity
- A touch of ScrollReveal.js for animations
- Font Awesome icons for visual elements

## How It's Organized
```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html    # The main page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css    # All the styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts.js    # Interactive elements
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/       # Images and resources
```

## Try It Out

Getting it running locally is easy:
```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/hasibshahriyar/portfolio

# Start it up with Python
python -m http.server 5501

# Or use VS Code's Live Server
```

## Cool Features Under the Hood

- Theme colors you can easily change
- Modern animations powered by Intersection Observer
- Interactive particle background using Canvas
- Responsive layouts with Grid and Flexbox

## Customization

Change the colors to match your style:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #ff5722;
    --secondary-color: #ff7043;
    --accent-color: #ff9800;
}
```

## Works Everywhere

I've made sure it looks great on:
- Phones (320px+)
- Tablets (768px+)
- Laptops (1024px+)
- Large monitors (1440px+)
