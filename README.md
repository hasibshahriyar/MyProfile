## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasibshahriyar/portfolio
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local development server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 5501
   
   # Using Live Server VS Code extension
   # Right click on index.html -> Open with Live Server

## 💻 Development

The website uses several key features:

- **CSS Variables** for consistent theming
- **Intersection Observer** for scroll-based animations
- **Canvas API** for particle animations
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox** for responsive layouts

## 🎨 Customization

1. Colors and themes can be modified in CSS variables:
   ```css
   :root {
       --primary-color: #ff5722;
       --secondary-color: #ff7043;
       --accent-color: #ff9800;
       /* ... other variables ... */
   }
   ```

2. Particle animation can be adjusted in `scripts.js`:
   ```javascript
   const particleSettings = {
       color: '#ff5722',
       count: 50,
       speed: 0.5
       // ... other settings ...
   };
   ```

## 📱 Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive and tested on:
- Mobile devices (320px and up)
- Tablets (768px and up)
- Desktops (1024px and up)
